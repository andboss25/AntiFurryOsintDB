Anti-furry OSINT DB is a web database interfacte that runs on port 1642 on local host.
The role of this interface is to give a place for one to store organized targets/investigations with attack vectors.

TARGET:

- Username furfag32453
- Platform yotube
  VECTORS 1:
- phone number: [his phone number here]
  VECTORS 2:
- ip: 127.0.0.1

**This is no intended to be hosted and let public as it has multiple vulnerabilities and no authentication , this is meant to be local only**

The vector types are pulled from config.json and can be modified.
The database file can also be encrypted and decrypted withthe help of decrypt.py and encrypt.py
